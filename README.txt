Assignment 6 - Part 1
Ashish Rai

OVERVIEW:

- This project contains a representation of an undirected graph using both an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix.
- The project performs BFS and DFS traversals and supports edge removal.

Extra Credit:
- Implemented detectCycle() to detect cycles in an undirected graph using DFS.

Functions Implemented:
- removeEdge()
- bfsM() - BFS using adjacency matrix
- dfsL() - DFS using adjacency list
- dfsM() - DFS using adjacency matrix
- detectCycle() - Extra credit (Detect a cycle in the graph)

Files included:
- graph.h - Header file for graph class
- graph.cpp - Implementation file for graph class
- sqll.h - Header file for linked list functions
- sqll.cpp - Implementation file for linked list functions
- mainGraph.cpp - Main file to test graph operations

To Compile:
